## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I've been practicing with small projects like this one for a while but a lack o motivation made me take a long break in my learning process. This project was perfect to remember the very basics of html and css and allowed me to apply some attributes that I havent used before such as "overflow", "box-sizing", "box-shadow"; selectors like :first-child and CSS Grid.

### Continued development
I'm aware that the classes and selectors used could be improved to make my code shorter and more understandable so on my next projects I'd try to do a better planning of this and to practice CSS grid.

### Useful resources

- [Box-shadow](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/box-shadow/) - This site helped me get the button's (Proceed Payment) shadow as close as possible.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
